# Introduction

Welcome to Kubidu — the deployment platform built for European companies who care about compliance, security, and sustainability.

## What is Kubidu?

Kubidu is a cloud deployment platform that makes it easy to deploy, scale, and manage your applications while staying compliant with European regulations.

Unlike other platforms, Kubidu was designed from the ground up with:

- **GDPR compliance** — Data stays in the EU, with built-in privacy controls
- **ISO 27001 certification** — Enterprise-grade security you can trust
- **100% renewable energy** — Every deployment is carbon-neutral

## Why Kubidu?

### For Developers

```bash
# Deploy in three commands
kubidu login
kubidu init
kubidu deploy
```

No Kubernetes YAML. No Terraform. No DevOps degree required.

### For Teams

- **Workspaces** — Organize projects by team or environment
- **Role-based access** — Fine-grained permissions for every team member
- **Audit logs** — Know who did what, when

### For Compliance Officers

- **Data residency** — All data stored in EU data centers (Frankfurt, Amsterdam)
- **DPA included** — Data Processing Agreement ready to sign
- **Right to deletion** — One-click data export and deletion

## How It Works

1. **Connect your code** — Link your GitHub, GitLab, or push directly
2. **Configure your app** — Set environment variables, domains, and resources
3. **Deploy** — Every push triggers an automatic deployment
4. **Scale** — Auto-scaling handles traffic spikes automatically
